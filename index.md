# Ultz Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Ultz Documentation Hub, your one-stop-shop for technical documentation on everything Ultz.

## This is a work-in-progress!
Documentation may not be complete, but we're actively trying to improve it! Want to help out? It's all open-source, just head over to https://github.com/Ultz/docs.ultz.co.uk

## Join the conversation
One of the best ways to get answers to your questions is to ask them to us directly! Some projects have dedicated support Discord servers, which you can join here:

- [Silk.NET's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DTHHXRt)
- [Volte's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/H8bcFr2)

Failing that, you can join the general-purpose Ultz server [here](https://discord.gg/qk6H4zq), however we may not be as able to answer questions as this is our primary work Discord! Please use the other Discord servers where possible.
